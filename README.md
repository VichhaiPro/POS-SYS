# Spa POS System

A simple, static Point of Sale (POS) system designed for a spa or salon. This web application is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and provides a clean, modern interface for managing services and sales.

## Features

*   **Service Management**: Display a grid of available services with their prices.
*   **Custom Services**: Add custom services or items with a name and price on the fly.
*   **Shopping Cart**: Add services to a shopping cart, which automatically calculates the subtotal.
*   **Discount Application**: Apply a percentage-based discount to the entire cart.
*   **Invoice Printing**: Generate and print a simple, clean invoice for the transaction.
*   **Khmer Language Support**: The user interface is translated into Khmer.
*   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Website**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **Add Services to Cart**: Click on any of the service cards to add them to the cart on the right.
3.  **Apply a Discount**: Enter a percentage in the "Discount %" field and click "Apply".
4.  **Add a Custom Service**: Click the "Add Custom Service" button, fill in the details in the modal, and click "Save Item".
5.  **Checkout**: Click the "Checkout" button to complete the transaction (this will currently show an alert and clear the cart).
6.  **Print Invoice**: Click the "Print Invoice" button to open the browser's print dialog for the current cart.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS3**: For styling the application, including a modern design with responsive layouts.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**: For all the client-side logic, including rendering services, managing the cart, and handling events.

## Future Improvements

*   **Service Images**: Add images for each service to make the interface more visually appealing.
*   **Persistence**: Use local storage to save the cart contents so they are not lost on page refresh.
*   **More Advanced Discounting**: Allow for fixed-amount discounts or discounts on individual items.
*   **Transaction History**: Keep a record of past transactions.
